# CNN-for-CIFAR-10-Object-Localization
A deep learning project implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR-10 image classification and object localization. The model is trained using PyTorch to classify images and predict bounding box coordinates, combining classification and regression tasks for enhanced visual understanding
